      "Break your 30 days into three micro-cycles: (1) Concept polish for arithmetic and geometry, (2) PYQ-driven practice with timer, (3) Mixed mocks. Add a 20-minute error log review nightly. Focus on high-yield chapters first: Percentage, Ratio, SI/CI, Time-Speed, Geometry basics. For advance maths, pair every concept with 15 timed questions. Keep a Saturday full-length sectional mock and Sunday full mock. Track attempt quality, not just score.",

Practice daily 3 answers: 2 GS, 1 Ethics case. Use keywords from the syllabus and current affairs. Peer review weekly to spot repetition. Maintain a personal example bank for value-add.",

      "Fix a solving order that plays to your strength. Run 4 sets of 12-minute micro-intervals daily: (1) Puzzles, (2) QA speed arithmetic, (3) English accuracy, (4) Mixed set. Track net score, not attempts. Use short drills for tables/squares, and maintain an error diary for traps. Two full mocks weekly; analyze within 45 minutes.",
